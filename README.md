# Assignment-3---Network-Automation-with-Ansible
Network Automation with Ansible in Virtual Environments and Presentation

Objective:
This assignment I completed aims to provide hands-on experience in automating network configurations using Ansible within virtual network environments. Groups will create Ansible playbooks for configuring network devices, implement VLANs, configure a routing protocol, use Jinja2 templates, develop an Ansible role, automate deployment with GitHub Actions, and secure sensitive data using Ansible Vault. The project concludes with a group presentation of the deployed lab.

Requirements:
Setup a virtual network environment using GNS3, Containerlab, or VMs to simulate 3-4 network devices (switches/routers).
Ansible installed on a control machine.
Basic understanding of YAML, Jinja2 templates, GitHub Actions, and the chosen network simulation tool.
A GitHub account.

Environment Setup:
GNS3: A graphical network simulator for complex networks, using 3 cisco routers and a switch
